*** Principled negotiation
    Focus not on what each side says it will or won't do but on finding common interests and solutions
**** Position
     - don't just stick with your original proposal if it opposes the child's. Look for something that you can agree on
**** Interests
     - different positions reflect different interests.

**** Expectations
     - there are usually rules/expectations that can't be changed
       - our family doesn't eat junk food
       - we don't watch shows with this type of content
     - sometimes these can be used to resolve a discussion, by showing how a child's desires go against the established family rules
**** Consensus
     - persitent kids need to hear "You are creative. You can find another solution. We are problem solvers."
     - arguments often arise when we're in a rush. You need to take time in the moment to let a kid explain themselves, think of another resolution

       time by having an earlier curfew
   - kids can help come up with consequences
   - set up consequences when everyone is calm
   - make child aware of consequences before any trangression occurs
   - reminder of consequences often enough
   - *punishment is often least effective means of getting good behavior*
   - more effective to teach appropriate skills and reinforcing your child when
     they use them
   - if families working well with spirited kids, consequences are employed as
     infrequently as once a month
** Finding the balance
   - spirited kids don't like when parents say no
*** Overcontrol makes us feel like a drill sergeant
*** Undercontrol makes us feel resentful
*** Balanced control feels like you're making progress

      on the short end
    - everyone seems happy and content. People are smiling; you can hear them
      laughing; they are working together
