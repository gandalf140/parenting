** Review your own message board
   - what did teachers, parents, friends tell you about your intensity when you were growing up?
   - what does intensity mean to you?
   - do you always think of intense reactions as bad and become angry at yourself/child when they happen?
   - change your internal dialog

       - he's just ignoring me
       - she doesn't respect me
       - I don't know what to do
       - I feel out of control
     - to
       - he's not out to get me
       - this isn't a plot
       - she must really be overwhelmed
       - we really have been too busy
       - everyone is so tired that even the little things are getting to us
       - what I'm doing isn't working but I can stop and change my strategy
       - he's only a child and he's learning

** using words
   - come up with good labels
     - you really stick to things that interest you
     - you are committed and decisive
     - you know what you want
     - you're assertive
     - your friends will never talk you into trouble unless you want it
     - you are independent and capable
** good parents do say yes
   Instill an ability to problem solve
** look for yes
   - ignoring persistent children may just make them scream louder
   - acknowledge them and try to communicate. Let them know you're listening
   - step away for a minute if you're too upset to listen
*** Principled negotiation
    Focus not on what each side says it will or won't do but on finding common interests and solutions
**** Position
     - don't just stick with your original proposal if it opposes the child's. Look for something that you can agree on
**** Interests
     - different positions reflect different interests. 
     - before an argument starts, try to understand what's important to your child
**** Expectations
     - there are usually rules/expectations that can't be changed
       - our family doesn't eat junk food
       - we don't watch shows with this type of content
     - sometimes these can be used to resolve a discussion, by showing how a child's desires go against the established family rules
**** Consensus
     - persitent kids need to hear "You are creative. You can find another solution. We are problem solvers."
     - arguments often arise when we're in a rush. You need to take time in the moment to let a kid explain themselves, think of another resolution
     - teach your child how to unlock from their position through example
       - "I wanted to go to the store right now, but it's raining too hard. I'll get soaked. I'll have to think of something else. That's hard for me to do. I really wanted to got right now"
     - brainstorm together. No idea should be thrown out during this time. Throw in some humorous ones as well
     - if you don't like an idea, don't oppose it directly. "That's one idea, can you think of two more?"
**** Evaluate
     - maybe the first set of solutions don't work for some reason. Come back together to evaluate
*** Are we too persistent
    - detect times when you're just being stubborn and look for opportunities to problem solve together or back away from the tension
*** Getting other to say yes
*** Feeling good about persistence
*** Good parents do say no
*** Clarify your rules
    - limit can communicate love
** Consequences that work
   - try to make punishment fit crime
     - if you don't clean your room, you don't get to do anything else until
       it's finished
     - you may have to do additional cleaning in order to practice the skill of cleaning
     - if you come home late, you will have to show you can be responsible about
       time by having an earlier curfew
   - kids can help come up with consequences
   - set up consequences when everyone is calm
   - make child aware of consequences before any trangression occurs
   - reminder of consequences often enough
   - *punishment is often least effective means of getting good behavior*
   - more effective to teach appropriate skills and reinforcing your child when
     they use them
   - if families working well with spirited kids, consequences are employed as
     infrequently as once a month
** Finding the balance
   - spirited kids don't like when parents say no
*** Overcontrol makes us feel like a drill sergeant
*** Undercontrol makes us feel resentful
*** Balanced control feels like you're making progress
    - it feels like everyone is getting what they need without anyone coming out
      on the short end
    - everyone seems happy and content. People are smiling; you can hear them
      laughing; they are working together
* Introvert/Extrovert
** Energy sources for introverts
   1. time alone
      - when they get agitated say "I think your body is telling you that you
        need some time alone"
      - take a break in many ways
        - quiet corner
        - read a book
        - walk
        - nap
        - playing in room
        - be alone with "security person" like mom
   2. physical space
   3. uninterrupted work time
** Energy sources for extroverts
   - time with people
     - talk with others on phone
     - invite children over to play
     - register in community activities
   - feedback
     - teach child to ask for attention from other parent, grandparents,
       teachers, and neighbors
   - people to help them think
     - teach them to let others know they are thinking out loud, they haven't
       reached a final decision
   - working together
* Sensitivity: Understanding how they feel
* Tantrums: Spotting the triggers
** Spirited children experience spill-over tantrums
   - kids are emotional barometers. Can soak in stress in family and then explode
   - these tantrums can't be stopped by ignoring them. They're not manipulation
     but a flood of emotion that the child can't control
** Spill-over tantrums appear during infancy
** Dealing with your own tantrums
   - "my child is in a spill-over tantrum, but I don't have to go there too"
** Look for the trigger
   - every time child has tantrum, write down when/where it happened and what
     time of day
     - examples
       - sensitive child senses your stress
       - persistent child isn't successful
       - slow-to-adapt child is surprised
       - energetic child isn't allowed to move
   - don't dismiss tantrum "there he goes again". He is overwhelmed beyond his
     capacity to cope
** Peak times
   - varies per child but may be consistent for a particular child
   - when your stress is high
     - example
       - mom was stressed about presentations she was giving and kid sensed it
       - decided to spend time with kid before leaving and then leave early before
         anxiety really set in
     - has one parent been traveling more or working longer hours?
     - worried about job security?
     - new addition to the family?
     - someone ill?
     - significant disruption in schedule?
     - play with child before stress overwhelms
     - get outside
   - late afternoons
     - tired and hungry
     - when child hasn't gotten sleep, rearrange plans to avoid stressful situations
   - developmental surges
     - around birthday and half birthday
     - brain is restructuring
     - can last four to six weeks
   - getting up and getting out
     - tired children who are woken out of sleep can be fragile
   - empty energy banks
     - introvert who hasn't had time ot recharge
** What to do with tantrums
   - stop the flood
     - if you can, stop whatever triggered your child
       - overstimulated, take to quiet place
       - shopping and too many transitions, forget about going to another store
       - still too long, find a place to let them run
       - isn't this giving in?
         - should train them with better tools to control themselves, but during
           the tantrum is not time to try and teach
   - stay with or near your child
     - girl started screaming when mom left daycare. They thought it was
       manipulative but she was a slow to adapt child
     - being left alone with strong emotions can be very frightening for children
     - if you're getting upset, walk away, but not for too long
   - touch them
     - hug, back scratch, warm gentl touch can help rebalance
     - during tantrum we don't feel gentle, but if we can regain control and
       reach out lightly rather than harshly, that can stop the flood
   - give them space
     - sometimes they need space instead
     - give them space but don't leave them alone
   - encourage your child to move
