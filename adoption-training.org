*** What is the difference between child abuse and child discipline?
* Culture and Identity

*** Racial awareness checklist
    - understand how my own cultural background influences the way I think, act, speak
    - recognize my own racial prejudice
    - aware of stereotypes that I may hold
    - examine my feelings about birth culture

    - place children in multicultural schools
    - place children with teachers who are racially aware and skilled with
      children of my child's race
    - where I live affects my child

    - how to deal with insensitive questions from strangers
* Disciplining the adopted child
** Anger and control issues - using empathy
   - adopted children may be more angry
   - use anger to feel in control
   - intimacy may make child feel vulnerable, leading to backlash of anger
   - responding in empathy diffuses anger
   - know your own anger patterns
   - strategies
     - lower voice instead of raising it
     - recognize when you are most vulnerable
       - and then try to remove additional stress during those times
     - don't forget to breathe
     - anticipate your child's triggers
     - follow through afterward
       - after tension is over, discuss what happened and educate/share emotions
** Public spaces
   - children crying is a natural thing
   - don't let pressure from others turn you against child - be advocate for child
** Discipline with an adoption twist
   - shame is not feeling that what I did was bad, but rather, that I am bad
     - they feel they deserve rejection because it must somehow be their fault
       that they lost their birth parents
   - for poorly attached children, discipline is experienced as rejection and contempt
   - discipline tools
     - state behavior expectations
     - stop bad behavior
     - correct without shame
     - re-attune child
   - sometimes matching a child's emotional intensity can be good, but try to
     choose good words
*** The extra layer
    - understand
    - express empathy
    - re-attune: child expresses repentance and accepts guidance
    - mommy or daddy time outs
*** The toolbox
    - parents often talk too unemotionally and rationally
    - 1 2 3 magic
      - a parent gives one explanation only
      - a parent's authority is not negotiable
      - parent gives three chances then time out
        - adoption twist, don't send to another room - keep them close and model
          calm controlled behavior
*** How to talk so kids will listen
    - listen with full attention
    - show a caring attitude
    - deal with feelings, both the parents' and child's
      - acknowledge reality of child's feelings - don't try to squash them
    - you don't need to fix it
      - adult reasoning not always soothing
      - just agree with desire while not granting it
    - describe the problem
    - use one word
    - talk about your feelings
    - the adoption twist
      - avoid giving in to child's demands out of fear child won't love you
      - being overly dismissive of feelings that adoptive child is trying to
        express (not really listening)
*** Behavior modification
    - reward positive behavior
    - reward chart
      - allow children to help select rewards
      - commit to time within which to fill out chart
    - adoption twist
      - only positive
      - if child not motivated by rewards, cause for concern
*** Time out and time in
    - time out
      - may not want to isolate child with attachment issues
      - could try time out but in a near by location
      - or child could sit and "think" on parent's lap
    - time in
      - child having chronic discipline issues could have a time in, where they
        are with the parent nearby for a whole day, where the parent can monitor
        and teach as the child reacts
*** love and logic
    - set firm limits in loving way
    - adoption twist
      - child may need additional instruction about why certain behavior is good
*** dealing with control
    - create dialog with child to find out what is fueling control behavior
*** 60 second scolding
    - parent comes close to child, makes eye contact, even gently holding face
      if necessary. Tells child firmly without shouting how the child's actions
      affected the parent. Parent then softens voice, hugs child, and tells him
      how much he is loved and assures him it is the parent's job to take care
      of child
    - adoption twist
      - fosters quick re-attunement between parent and child
      - re-attunement: emotional reconnection with your child after you've disciplined
** Guilt, shame, and the adopted child 
*** One is a healthy reaction to wrongdoing, one is toxic
    - guilt is external - "I did something bad"
    - shame is internalized - "I am bad"
      - in adopted kids can be traced to children being abandoned or relinquished
      - "I must have been a very bad baby to make my mother give me away"
      - I am so bad inside, that my own mother didn't love me.
      - Everyone will know I am bad inside when they find out I am adopted.
      - What do I say when kids ask "Why didn't your real mother keep you?".
      - I was a bad baby so I'm a bad kid and I am powerless to become good.
      - My adoptive parents don't understand how bad, how worthless, I really am.
*** Coping skills
    - separate the behavior from the child
      - "making a bad choice" vs "I am bad so my choices are bad"
    - a reprimand that feeds shame
      - You little brat! How many times have I told you not to hit your brother! Why are you so nasty?! When will you learn?
    - a reprimand ending in reattunement
      - I am really mad at your behavior. Hitting is never appropriate! You must have been very angry at your brother but you need to apologize and I will come with you (gently and firmly take child by hand to make an apology; follow with a big hug and "I'm proud of you" after the child apologizes).
*** A different approach
    - children with ADHD and other learning disabilities need different
      approaches than other children
** Being with your child in public places
*** Help your child ward off a mad attack
    - things for parent's to say
      - "Stop and think. Make a good choice."
      - "Remember to breathe when your tummy gets tight. Breathe. Let's breathe together."
      - "Use your words, not your fists. People are not for hurting."
      - "You can do it. I know you can get your mads under control."
      - "I understand, right now you are feeling mad. Still, you can't hurt people, things or yourself."
      - "You are the kind of kid who can take care of his own bad feelings."
      - "Go to a safe place and draw out your mads."
      - "You have a choice: Talk out your feelings or go to time out and get your mads under control."
      - "Well, I'm feeling mad right now myself. I'm going to go cool off, then we'll talk."
      - "I know how you feel. Sometimes I get mad myself. Then I tell myself, that it is OK to be mad if you are nice about it."
      - "Thanks for sharing your angry feelings. Good choice in using your words!"
      - "We are learning to be a 'Speak your feelings' kind of family. No more "Mad Family' for us."
      - "I believe in you. Sometimes it's tough, isn't it?"
      - "You are one terrific kid!"
*** What do I do when my child falls apart in the...
    - spend one-on-one time with your child before you take him to a public place
    - when you see an upset beginning, immediately make real contact
      - try to get them to laugh
    - slow down the action, and listen
    - if necessary, move to a more socially acceptable place
    - plan what you will say to people who express their opinions or concern
      - "It's that kind of day!"
      - something that lets people know you're in charge
    - "feelings" faces
      - make paper plate faces attached to popsicle sticks that represent
        different feelings
      - when someone acts up, grab the matching plate face
      - ask child to pick a plate face to show how they feel
      - then have them pick a face to make everyone feel better
** Out of control parents
   - pay attention to child's cues to head off meltdown before it begins
   - verbalize irritation a few steps before you lose it
   - "special phrase" to signal to children that you're about to lose it
   - talk about feelings a lot. Empathy helps diffuse anger
   - after child metdown, analyze what went wrong with them and come up with
     better solutions to express mad without losing control (could even role-play)
